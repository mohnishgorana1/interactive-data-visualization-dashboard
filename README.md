# 1. Build a Bar Chart to Represent the Features
    Purpose: The bar chart visually represents the performance or usage of different features (A, B, C, etc.) over a specified time range. This allows users to quickly assess which features are being used more or less frequently.
    X-axis Representation:
    The x-axis of the bar chart will represent the total time spent on each feature during the selected date range. This means you will sum the values of features A, B, C, D, E, and F from your data for the chosen period, providing an aggregated view of how much time users interacted with each feature.
    Data Aggregation: To prepare for this, you will need to aggregate the data by the chosen date range. For example, if users select a date range from October 1 to October 5, you would sum the values for A, B, C, D, E, and F for those days. The resulting values will determine the height of each bar in the chart.
    
# 2. Implement a Line Chart to Display the Time Trend of a Particular Category
    Interactive Detail: This feature allows users to click on a specific bar in the bar chart to see a more detailed view of the time spent on a particular feature over time. This interaction provides deeper insights into how usage of that feature changes day by day or over the selected range.
    Line Chart Setup:
    When a user clicks on a bar (e.g., representing feature A), the line chart will update to show the time trend specifically for that feature across the days in the selected date range.
    The x-axis of the line chart will represent the days, while the y-axis will show the total time spent on that feature.
    Pan and Zoom Functionality:
    To enhance user experience, the chart should support pan, zoom-in, and zoom-out actions. This allows users to explore the data more granularly or to get an overview of longer time periods. Libraries like Chart.js offer built-in functionality or plugins for zooming and panning, making it easier for users to analyze trends over time.
    Summary
    # By implementing these two points, you create a comprehensive data visualization tool that allows users to not only view aggregate feature  usage over time but also dive deeper into specific trends and patterns, enhancing their ability to make data-driven decisions based on user engagement.
